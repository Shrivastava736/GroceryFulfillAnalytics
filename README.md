# GroceryFulfillAnalytics

**OVERVIEW**
A two‑week sprint to uncover operational bottlenecks in a hyper‑local grocery delivery service based in Bengaluru, India. By combining order, delivery‐tracking and customer‑rating data, I created some insights on hotspots and churn drivers, then simulated incentives to test potential fixes.

**KEY FINDINGS**
**Order‑Level**
- Sunday, 14:00‑17:00 is the single busiest slot (967 orders).  
- Late‑night (23:00‑05:00) orders pay ↟ 2× delivery fee yet show rising demand.

**Completion‑Rate**
- Orders with ≤ 10 items sustain ≥ 99 % completion.  
- Peak‑hour (12:00‑17:00) completion dips on Fri/Sat (‑4 pp).

**Customer Experience**
- Late‑night deliveries average 4.6⭐, highest across slots.  
- Daytime slots see 1‑⭐/2‑⭐ spikes; traffic induced delays cited in 38 % of comments.

**Delivery Efficiency**
- HSR Layout & ITI Layout deliver fastest (median = 23 min).  
- Sarjapur Road lags (median = 37 min) with sharp May spike due to roadworks.


**RECOMMENDATION**
- **Extend driver fleet** 14:00‑17:00 on weekends.  
- **11 % promo discount** for 23:00‑05:00 orders to absorb higher fees and grow volume.  
- **New micro‑hub** near Sarjapur Road to cut last‑mile distance by 22 %.
